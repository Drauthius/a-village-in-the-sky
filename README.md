A Village in the Sky
====================

*A Village in the Sky* is a relaxing world builder, city builder, and city management game combined. Peaceful
Vikings have migrated to the skies, and need your guidance to establish a thriving village.

The game was under development by myself on my spare time. It started as a spin-off of the Ludum
Dare 38 game-jam theme "Small world" in April 2017, with the goal of becoming a small and relaxing
city management game.
